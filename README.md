	  pulltorefresh_flutter: "^0.0.3"
	  
If you want to use the default refresh image of this project (the rotated image), please download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baoolong/PullToRefresh_Flutter/master/images/refresh.png to your images folder, and Pubspec.yaml is declared as follows.
If you want to use other images, put the image in the Images folder, declare it in the Pubspec.yaml file, and add the property refreshIconPath in the PullAndPush class.

     assets:
       - images/refresh.png
	
Add it to your dart file:

	import 'package:pulltorefresh_flutter/pulltorefresh_flutter.dart';
## Example
    class PullAndPushTestState extends State<PullAndPushTest>{
	  	List<String> addStrs=["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"];
	  	List<String> strs=["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0"];
	  	ScrollController controller=new ScrollController();
	  	ScrollPhysics scrollPhysics=new AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics();
	  	//使用系统的请求
	  	var httpClient = new HttpClient();
	  	var url = "https://github.com/";
	  	var _result="";
	
	
	  	@override
	 	 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	      return new Scaffold(
	        appBar: new AppBar(
	          title: new Text("上下拉刷新"),
	        ),
	        body: new PullAndPush(
	          listView: new ListView.builder(
	            //ListView的Item
	            itemCount: strs.length,//+2,
	            controller: controller,
	            physics: scrollPhysics,
	            itemBuilder: (BuildContext context,int index){
	              return new Container(
	                height: 35.0,
	                child: new Center(
	                  child: new Text(strs[index],style: new TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0),),
	                ),
	              );
	            }
	          ),
	          loadData: (isPullDown) async{
	            try {
	              var request = await httpClient.getUrl(Uri.parse(url));
	              var response = await request.close();
	              if (response.statusCode == HttpStatus.OK) {
	                _result = await response.transform(utf8.decoder).join();
	                setState(() {
	                  //拿到数据后，对数据进行梳理
	                  if(isPullDown){
	                    strs.clear();
	                    strs.addAll(addStrs);
	                  }else{
	                    strs.addAll(addStrs);
	                  }
	                });
	              } else {
	                _result = 'error code : ${response.statusCode}';
	              }
	            } catch (exception) {
	              _result = '网络异常';
	            }
	            print(_result);
	          },
	          scrollPhysicsChanged: (ScrollPhysics physics) {
	            //必须写成这样  无需改动 只需Copy即可 Must be written like this, no need to change, just copy
	            setState(() {
	              scrollPhysics=physics;
	            });
	          },)
	      );
  	    }
	  }

## Notice
有时ListView的Item太少而不能铺满屏幕，导致ListView 不可Scroll，PullToRefresh也不可使用，所以ScrollPhysics必须是AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics。

Sometimes the ListView has too few items to cover the screen, making the ListView not scrollable, and PullToRefresh is not available, so ScrollPhysics must be AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics.
